== Description ==

This is a Payments.GY Payment Gateway for WooCommerce.

Users must have a verified payments.gy account to process payments.

The integration is seemless with no need for complicated API keys.

== Installation ==

<b>Minimum Requirements</b>

In the search field type “Payments.GY” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the
point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now".

<b>Manual installation</b>

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with credit cards or just Payments.GY? =

This plugin does not support credit card payments. There is room for this feature as the core platform evolves.

You get paid immediately. The order status in your WooCommerce orders section will change from `Pending Payment` to `On Hold` and payment will display in your Payments.GY Merchant account.
